### Task Question

Nautilus developers are actively working on one of the project repositories, /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog. They were doing some testing and created few test branches, now they want to clean those test branches. Below are the requirements that have been shared with the DevOps team:

On Storage server in Stratos DC delete a branch named xfusioncorp_blog from /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog git repo.

### Solution

o delete a branch named xfusioncorp_blog from the Git repository located at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog on the Storage server in Stratos DC, you can use the following Git command:

first to delete the branch switch to main branch using git branch master

```bash
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog
git branch -D xfusioncorp_blog
```

This command deletes the specified branch (xfusioncorp_blog) from the local repository. If the branch contains unmerged changes, Git will prevent you from deleting it unless you force the deletion. To force the deletion and remove the branch even if it contains unmerged changes, use the -D option instead of -d:

```bash
git branch -D xfusioncorp_blog
```

After executing the command, the branch xfusioncorp_blog will be deleted from the local repository. Remember that this operation only affects the local repository, so if you want to reflect these changes in the remote repository, you need to push the changes after deleting the branch:

```bash
git push origin --delete xfusioncorp_blog
```
