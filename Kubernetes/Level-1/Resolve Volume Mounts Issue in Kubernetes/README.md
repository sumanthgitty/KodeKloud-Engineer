### Question
We encountered an issue with our Nginx and PHP-FPM setup on the Kubernetes cluster this morning, which halted its functionality. Investigate and rectify the issue:

The pod name is nginx-phpfpm and configmap name is nginx-config. Identify and fix the problem.

Once resolved, copy /home/thor/index.php file from the jump host to the nginx-container within the nginx document root. After this, you should be able to access the website using Website button on the top bar.

### Solution 

### Steps

1.Ensure Matching ConfigMap and Pod Volume Paths:

Verify that the mountPath specified in the pod's volume definition matches the path where the configuration data from the ConfigMap should be accessed within the container.

2.Replace Pod Definition:

Use kubectl replace command to apply any necessary updates to the pod definition YAML file:

```bash
kubectl replace -f path/to/pod-definition.yaml
```

3.Copy File to Pod:

Copy the index.php file from /home/thor/index.php on the jump host to /var/www/html/index.php within the nginx-phpfpm pod's php-fpm-container using kubectl cp:

```bash
kubectl cp /home/thor/index.php nginx-phpfpm:/var/www/html/index.php -c php-fpm-container
```
