## Cron schedule deny to users

### Problem

To stick with the security compliances, the Nautilus project team has decided to apply some restrictions on crontab
access so that only allowed users can create/update the cron jobs. Limit crontab access to below specified users on App
Server 1.

Allow crontab access to siva user and deny the same to rod user.
