## Resolve Dockerfile Issues

### Problem

The Nautilus DevOps team is working to create new images per requirements shared by the development team. One of the
team members is working to create a Dockerfile on App Server 1 in Stratos DC. While working on it she ran into issues in
which the docker build is failing and displaying errors. Look into the issue and fix it to build an image as per details
mentioned below:

a. The Dockerfile is placed on App Server 1 under /opt/docker directory.

b. Fix the issues with this file and make sure it is able to build the image.

c. Do not change base image, any other valid configuration within Dockerfile, or any of the data been used â€” for
example, index.html.

Note: Please note that once you click on FINISH button all existing images, the containers will be destroyed and new
image will be built from your Dockerfile.

### Solution

- Build original Dockerfile to determine the issue: `docker build -t httpd .`

```shell

```

-> The problem is wrong path of files

- Fix: See [Fixed Dockerfile](./fixed/Dockerfile)

- Rebuild image: `docker build -t httpd .`
- Run built image: `docker run -p 8080:8080 httpd`
