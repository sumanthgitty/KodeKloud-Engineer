## Task:

xFusionCorp Industries has planned to set up a common email server in Stork DC. After several meetings and recommendations, they have decided to use `postfix` as their mail transfer agent and `dovecot` as an `IMAP/POP3` server. We would like you to perform the following steps:

1. Install and configure postfix on Stork DC mail server.

2. Create an email account `ammar@stratos.xfusioncorp.com` identified by `B4zNgHA7Ya`.

3. Set its mail directory to `/home/ammar/Maildir`.

4. Install and configure dovecot on the same server.
