## Jenkins Installation

### Problem

The DevOps team of xFusionCorp Industries is planning to setup some CI/CD pipelines. After several meetings they have
decided to use Jenkins server. So, we need to setup a Jenkins Server as soon as possible. Please complete the task as
per requirements mentioned below:

1. Install jenkins on jenkins server using yum utility only, and start its service. You might face timeout issue while
   starting the Jenkins service, please refer this link for help.


2. Jenkin's admin user name should be theadmin, password should be Adm!n321, full name should be Javed and email should
   be javed@jenkins.stratos.xfusioncorp.com.

Note:

1. For this task ssh into jenkins server using user root and password S3curePass from jump host.


2. To complete the jenkins installation after installing packages and after starting the jenkins service, click on the
   Jenkins button on the top bar.
